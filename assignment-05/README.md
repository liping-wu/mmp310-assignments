# Assignment 5
## Multimedia Programming II (MMP 310)

Spring 2017

Instructor: Roy Vanegas

## Description
This assignment is designed to get you to practice writing robust code. In this case, youâ€™ll be adding an error-checking layer to an existing code base.

Here are some examples of what to check for:

* Is negative input allowed?
* Are strings allowed in your input?
* Are references to DOM components valid?
* Have elements been created?

These should be enough to get you started.
