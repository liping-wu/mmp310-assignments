# Assignment 3
## Multimedia Programming II (MMP 310)

Spring 2017

Instructor: Roy Vanegas

## Description
This assignment is designed to get you working with event listeners and dynamic scripting. Inspect the scaffold of this project and open `index.html`.

Clicking on the `Enlarge` button should make the width and height of the box 100 pixels larger. If, after the user clicks the `Enlarge` button, the box becomes larger than `500 × 500`, an alert modal should notify the user that the box is too large, and then **not** increase the width and height of the box.

Conversely, clicking the `Shrink` button should make the width and the height of the box 100 pixels smaller. If, after the user click the `Shrink` button, the box becomes smaller than `100 × 100`, an alert modal should notify the user that the box is too small, and then **not** decrease the width and height of the box.

View the movie at [`http://roy.vanegas.org/teaching/files/enlarge-shrink-div.mov`](http://roy.vanegas.org/teaching/files/enlarge-shrink-div.mov) to gather a better understanding of how the solution to this assignment should work.

**Note**: You may not alter `css/style.css` or `index.html`; do all your work in `js/app.js`.
